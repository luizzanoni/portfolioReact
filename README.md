# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Um pouco sobre a história.

Dado inicio deste projeto final do semestre de 2022/2 pois gostaria de atualizar meus conceitos sobre React e pelo fato de que daqui a alguns dias comecarei a utulizar o mesmo para codar o novo sistema.
Para entender a estrutura foram necessários algumas horas pois não tinha muito conhecimento front para realizar o que gostaria. Após isso, defini um layout para execução me baseando em vídeos no Youtube.
Foram gastas aproximadamente 34 horas neste projeto e algumas ajudas de colegas (Leonardo), trabalha comigo e é front, ajudou muito no inicio para entender front e como toda a estrutura funcionava.
Obrigado pessoal.

Deixei comentado para quem chegou até, saber que ainda tinha um easter egg hahahah
